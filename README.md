# Hypergate

Kubernetes-native Envoy Management Server for Envoy-based front-proxies.

# Warning!

This is alpha / pre-alpha software. The project in its current form exists primarily as a sandbox for experimenting with Envoy.

# Rationale

Lyft's Envoy proxy is a powerful piece of technology and I believe a cornerstone of future Cloud Native and Kubernetes Native computing. I created this as a project to explore a few things:

- Creation of a custom xDS v2 management server.
- Explore various configuration UX ideas.
- To learn!
